Description             : This map is on the PS2 version of Unreal Torunament of the
			  same name.
Additional Credits to   : Tom "Master" Godwin for testing and feedback.  I found this
			  tutorial site very useful:
			  http://www.game-edit.com/tutorials/Unreal/.  THANKS to everyone
                          that took the time to make thoes tutorials!
Notes                   : This is my 6th and final PS2 map (see list at bottom).  I kinda
			  rushed this one and it shows.  There are 7 levels in the PS2 version
			  that arent in the PC version.  I've done all but 1 because its 
			  lame.  I really want to start one of my own but I just had to 
			  finish these.  They are a blast on PS2 and even better on PC, and 
			  they play well online.
