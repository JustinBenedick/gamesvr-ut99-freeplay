AUTHOR'S NOTES
==============

This map is based on the Goldeneye map of the same name. A map pack will be released soon which will include all the DM levels from Goldeneye, which Kain and I will be releasing. For more information check out the Advanced Editing forum at the Nali City BBS. I recommend that this level is played using Infiltration Team Deathmatch, with 4 people.
   
Credits: I'd like to thank Kain for making the level pack with me, to see some of his work you can also get Archives, Library, Stack, and Temple. Thanks to Joshua, Billy Bad Ass,Floyd,Travis and all the other people at the Nali City forum for helping me make the levels better. And most of all, thanks to Rare, the creators of THE best game ever made!
