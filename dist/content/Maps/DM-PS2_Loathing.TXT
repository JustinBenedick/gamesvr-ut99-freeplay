Description             : This map is on the PS2 version of Unreal Torunament of the
			  same name.  I'm not sure if this map is PS2 version only or
			  not, I havent seen it anywhere else.  It is a small industrial
			  type map that plays 4 - 6.  Everything is an exact copy of the
                          PS2 version - layout, textures, item placement, music, etc...
Additional Credits to   : Tom "Master" Godwin and Josh "LittleRedJBT" Turner for testing
			  and feedback.  I found this tutorial site very useful:
			  http://www.game-edit.com/tutorials/Unreal/.  THANKS to everyone
                          that took the time to make thoes tutorials!
Notes                   : This is my first finished map.  Copying from the console version
			  made things alot easier.  I recommend doing something like this
			  when making your first map.  I learned to use the editor while not
			  worrying about architecture and item placement and stuff like that.
