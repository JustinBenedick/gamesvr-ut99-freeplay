Description             : This map is on the PS2 version of Unreal Torunament of the
			  same name.
Additional Credits to   : Tom "Master" Godwin for testing and feedback.  I found this
			  tutorial site very useful:
			  http://www.game-edit.com/tutorials/Unreal/.  THANKS to everyone
                          that took the time to make thoes tutorials!
Notes                   : This is my 4th map.  I couldnt find all the same textures so I
			  selected some that look ok.  Also, the PS2 version didnt have any
			  music in it (mabey a glitch on my copy or something) so I picked
			  a song that is fitting.
