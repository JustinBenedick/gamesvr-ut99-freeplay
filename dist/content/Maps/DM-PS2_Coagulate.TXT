Description             : This map is on the PS2 version of Unreal Torunament of the
			  same name.
Additional Credits to   : Tom "Master" Godwin for testing and feedback.  I found this
			  tutorial site very useful:
			  http://www.game-edit.com/tutorials/Unreal/.  THANKS to everyone
                          that took the time to make thoes tutorials!
Notes                   : This is my 5th map.  So far of all the PS2 levels this has been the
			  most fun to make.  The texture pack (Shanes Church) is one of the
			  best in there.  There's lots of cool deco in this one compared to
			  the others.  The architecture was fun, pillars, arched doors, and 
			  curved staircases - all were good practice with the editor.
