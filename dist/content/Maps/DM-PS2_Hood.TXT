Description             : This map is on the PS2 version of Unreal Torunament of the
			  same name.  It is very similar to DOM-Condemned, same textures
			  and basic style.  Everything is copied from the PS2 version -
 			  layout, textures, item placement, music, etc...
Additional Credits to   : Tom "Master" Godwin for testing and feedback.  I found this
			  tutorial site very useful:
			  http://www.game-edit.com/tutorials/Unreal/.  THANKS to everyone
                          that took the time to make thoes tutorials!
Notes                   : This is my second map.  I had some concerns about the PS2 version.
			  For a pretty big map it only had 5 player starts so I took the
			  liberty of adding another 3.  Also the PS2 version has 0 (yes, ZERO!)
			  health items in it.  Staying faithful to the console version I
			  left it out, it actually forces you to play a bit more cautious.
			  Still fun none the less!  The big change from the PS2 version is 
			  you are now able to get on top of the buildings.  I wont let the
			  bots get up there to keep it more PS2'ish, but players can if they
			  want.  Not much goin on up there, not much of an advantage either.
			  I always wanted to get up there but couldnt, so this was just for
			  shits and giggles.  Also, watch out for the lifts.  If you are under
			  one it will crush your ass (-100 health).  Occasionally a bot would
			  get stuck under there until someone happend along its path, so untill
			  I get better at pathnoding - stupid bots get mashed.  Enjoy!
