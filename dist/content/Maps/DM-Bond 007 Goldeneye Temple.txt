NOTES
=====
To play the level copy 007tex.utx to your textures directory
This level may need a power-PC to run as it is full of fog (no slowdown on my 
computer but then again I've got a P400, 128MB RAM, Voodoo3 3000)
If you are a sniper you should have a good time on this level.
A map pack is being released soon by some other people and me containing all 
the Goldeneye levels - head on over to Nali City BBS (www.planetunreal.com./nalicity) 
to discover more.


I really don't care, or have any control, over what you do with this map 
(just don't sell it).
