Description             : A conversion of most peoples fave Quake2 DM level into UT.  I thought it would be easy, but
				turned out to be very very difficult due the shape and untidiness of the original.
				This was because the editor was much more primitive than UnrealEd and automatic curved
				stair cases (and certain other shapes) could not be done with ease back then.
				Considering this, the original is a work of art.

Other Levels by author: 		DM- Installation Alpha
				DM- Crypt Of Qapla'	
				DM-Amethyst
