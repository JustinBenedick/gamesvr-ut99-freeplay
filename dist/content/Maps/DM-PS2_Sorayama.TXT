Description             : This map is on the PS2 version of Unreal Torunament of the
			  same name.
Additional Credits to   : Tom "Master" Godwin for testing and feedback.  I found this
			  tutorial site very useful:
			  http://www.game-edit.com/tutorials/Unreal/.  THANKS to everyone
                          that took the time to make thoes tutorials!
Notes                   : This is my third map.  I had some troubles getting the scale 
			  right on this one, but it came out ok.  Also, the lifts gave me
			  fits.  After building one i tested and couldnt get on it!  For 
			  some reason it put an invisible wall in front of the lift.  I 
			  deleted and rebuilt several times and finally got one to work.
			  I copied from it and edited the vertexes to make the other ones,
			  so a few have misalligned textures.  If anyone knows why this
			  happened please let me know!  Thanks in advance.
