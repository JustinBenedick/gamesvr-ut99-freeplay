Inspired by one of the greatest games of all time - Goldeneye

PLAY INFORMATION
================

    Single Player           : Botmatch
    Cooperative             : No
    Deathmatch              : Yes
    Difficulty Settings     : No
    New Sounds              : No
    New Graphics            : Yes - 007tex.utx
    Known Glitches          : None

This level is for Unreal Tournament and if you want an Unreal version (no idea why you
would...) convert it yourself. 
If you have other 007 levels, the texture file you download with THIS map is the one to use.
It prevents you having to constantly replace the file.

============
 
    Editor(s) used          : UnrealED
    Build Time              : 3 days maybe?


NOTES
=====
Erm, what do i say?
Oh yeah a map pack is being released soon by some other people and me containing all 
the Goldeneye levels - head on over to Nali City BBS (www.planetunreal.com./nalicity) 
to discover more.

I really don't care, or have any control, over what you do with this map 
(just don't sell it).
