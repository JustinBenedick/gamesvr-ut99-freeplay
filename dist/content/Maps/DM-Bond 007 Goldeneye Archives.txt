NOTES
=====

Many thanks to Beppo - the UnrealScript king.
A map pack is being released soon by some other people and me containing all 
the Goldeneye levels - head on over to Nali City BBS (www.planetunreal.com./nalicity) 
to discover more.


I really don't care, or have any control, over what you do with this map 
(just don't sell it).
