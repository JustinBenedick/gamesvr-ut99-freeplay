MoreGore_LGE - Ludicrous Gibs Edition. by Mr.Loathsome.
 *based on the MoreGore v2 muator by -shiftre, Clan 404

LGE Update:  Removed the DigDug mode and its associated overhead.
             Mutator now scales the gib chunks based on the drawscale
             of the pawn that is being gibbed.

Description:  

   This mutator allows you to increase the amount of gore generated when gibbing
another player or monster, creating very messy and in someways, artistic deaths.

MoreGorePlus update primarly adds a few timer variables and a rewrite of the core gib
spawing code in the mutator to attempt to remove the lag the original version had 
at any but the lowest settings.

Also implements support for greenblood on the blood spray.

Instructions:

Just install into your System directory.   For servers, no need to add as a serverpackage.

To change the gore level, select Mod/MoreGore Setup from the UT Menu, and use the slider to set the
goreLevel to a value between 1-40. It set to 1 by default (1 being 2x the gore).
Suggest settings between 1 and 10.

SpawnRate slider controls how quickly the mutator will attempt to spawn the gibs on player or monsters
death.  Higher value = longer delay before next death spawns gibs.

GibRate controls how fast the mutator will spawn goreLevel # of gibbed carcasses.
Best range seems to be 0.25 - 0.50.   Higher will produce a noticible pulse in the gib spawns.
(Which may or may not be bad....)

For servers, set the goreLevel a bit lower, and the rates a bit higher than you would for offline play.

Have fun !
